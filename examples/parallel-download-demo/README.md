# Parallel Download & Checksum Demo

This example demonstrates the new parallel download and checksum verification features of gollama.cpp.

## Features Demonstrated

- **Parallel Downloads**: Download libraries for multiple platforms simultaneously
- **Checksum Verification**: Automatic SHA256 calculation and verification
- **Platform Detection**: Automatic detection of correct library files (.so, .dylib, .dll)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of download failures

## Usage

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Expected Output

```

## Command Line Usage

For more control, use the command-line tool:

```bash
# Download for all platforms with checksums
go run ../../cmd/gollama-download -download-all -checksum

# Download for specific platforms
go run ../../cmd/gollama-download -platforms "linux/amd64,darwin/arm64,windows/amd64" -checksum

# Download all GPU variants for current platform (CPU, CUDA, Vulkan, etc.)
go run ../../cmd/gollama-download -download-variants -checksum

# Download all GPU variants for a specific platform
go run ../../cmd/gollama-download -download-variants -platforms "linux/amd64" -checksum

# Verify checksum of a file
go run ../../cmd/gollama-download -verify-checksum /path/to/file

# Use Makefile targets
make -C ../.. download-libs-parallel
make -C ../.. download-libs-platforms
```

## Variant Downloads

The `-download-variants` flag downloads all available GPU backend variants for a platform:

- **Linux**: CPU, CUDA (various versions), HIP/ROCm, Vulkan, SYCL
- **Windows**: CPU, CUDA, HIP, Vulkan, OpenCL, SYCL
- **macOS**: CPU only (Metal is built-in)

All variants are downloaded in parallel, extracted to separate directories, and common files are verified to be identical across variants. This ensures that core libraries are consistent while GPU-specific components differ as expected.

## Performance Benefits

- **Parallel Processing**: Downloads multiple platforms simultaneously (up to 4 concurrent)
- **Reduced Wait Time**: Total download time is reduced from sequential to maximum single download time
- **Integrity Verification**: SHA256 checksums ensure downloaded files are not corrupted
- **Caching**: Downloaded libraries are cached and reused across downloads
