# librallama.cpp Tools Documentation

This document describes the various tools and scripts included with gollama.cpp.

## Scripts Directory (`scripts/`)

### update-changelog.sh - CHANGELOG.md Management

The `update-changelog.sh` script automates the management of the `CHANGELOG.md` file during the release process. It's integrated into the `tag-release` target in the Makefile.

#### Features

- Converts `[Unreleased]` sections to versioned entries with current date
- Adds new `[Unreleased]` sections for future development
- Updates existing version entries when tags are moved
- Automatic verification and backup/restore on failure

#### Usage

```bash
# Convert [Unreleased] to versioned entry
bash scripts/update-changelog.sh "1.0.0" "release"

# Add new [Unreleased] section
bash scripts/update-changelog.sh "1.0.1" "unreleased"
```

#### Integration with tag-release

The script is automatically called during `make tag-release`:
1. Before tagging: Updates CHANGELOG.md to convert `[Unreleased]` to current version
2. After tagging: Adds new `[Unreleased]` section for next development cycle

See [CHANGELOG_MANAGEMENT.md](CHANGELOG_MANAGEMENT.md) for detailed documentation.

### test-changelog-workflow.sh - Changelog Testing

Test script that simulates the entire changelog update workflow without making permanent changes.

```bash
bash scripts/test-changelog-workflow.sh
```

### hf.sh - Hugging Face Model Downloader

The `hf.sh` script is a powerful utility for downloading models from Hugging Face. It's automatically copied from the llama.cpp repository to ensure compatibility with the current llama.cpp version.

#### Installation

The script is automatically installed when you run:

```bash
make clone-llamacpp
```

To force an update of the script:

```bash
make update-hf-script
```

#### Usage

##### Basic Usage

```bash
# Download by direct URL
./scripts/hf.sh https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-GGUF/resolve/main/tinyllama-1.1b-chat-v1.0.Q2_K.gguf

# Download using repository and file name
./scripts/hf.sh --repo TheBloke/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-GGUF --file tinyllama-1.1b-chat-v1.0.Q2_K.gguf

# Download to specific directory
./scripts/hf.sh --repo TheBloke/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-GGUF --file tinyllama-1.1b-chat-v1.0.Q2_K.gguf --outdir models
```

##### Options

- `--url <url>`: Direct URL to the model file
- `--repo <repo>`: Hugging Face repository (format: `owner/repo-name`)
- `--file <filename>`: Specific file to download from the repository
- `--outdir <directory>`: Output directory (default: current directory)
- `-h, --help`: Show help message

#### Integration with Examples

The script is integrated with various example projects:

```bash
# Download models for all examples
make model_download

# Example-specific downloads (from example directories)
cd examples/gritlm
make model_download
```

### Other Scripts

#### check-docs.sh
Validates documentation consistency and formatting.

#### increment-version.sh
Utility for version management and release preparation.

## Command Line Tools (`cmd/`)

### gollama-download

The `gollama-download` tool manages llama.cpp library downloads and caching.

#### Installation

Built automatically with the project:

```bash
make build
```

#### Usage

```bash
# Download libraries for current platform
go run ./cmd/gollama-download -download -version b6089

# Test download functionality
go run ./cmd/gollama-download -test-download

# Clean library cache
go run ./cmd/gollama-download -clean-cache
```

#### Options

- `-download`: Download libraries for the current platform
- `-version <build>`: Specify llama.cpp build version (e.g., "b6089")
- `-test-download`: Test the download functionality
- `-clean-cache`: Remove all cached libraries

## Makefile Targets

### Model Management

```bash
# Download example models using hf.sh
make model_download

# Clean model cache
make clean-libs

# Synchronise embedded llama.cpp libraries for go:embed
make populate-libs
```

### Script Management

```bash
# Clone llama.cpp and install/update hf.sh script
make clone-llamacpp

# Force update hf.sh script to latest version
make update-hf-script
```

### Development Tools

```bash
# Install development tools (linters, security scanners)
make install-tools

# Run all quality checks
make check

# Format, vet, lint, and test
make fmt vet lint sec test
```

## Integration Examples

### Using hf.sh in Your Projects

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Example: Download a model for your application

MODEL_DIR="./models"
HF_SCRIPT="./scripts/hf.sh"

# Ensure the script exists
if [ ! -f "$HF_SCRIPT" ]; then
    echo "Installing hf.sh script..."
    make clone-llamacpp
fi

# Download a specific model
echo "Downloading model..."
$HF_SCRIPT --repo microsoft/DialoGPT-medium --file pytorch_model.bin --outdir $MODEL_DIR

echo "Model downloaded to $MODEL_DIR"
```

### Automated Model Management

The project includes automated model management through Make targets that handle:

1. **Dependency Checking**: Ensures `hf.sh` script is available
2. **Conditional Downloads**: Only downloads if model doesn't exist
3. **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages and recovery instructions
4. **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on all supported platforms

## Troubleshooting

### Script Not Found

If you get an error about `hf.sh` not being found:

```bash
# Install the script
make clone-llamacpp

# Or force update
make update-hf-script
```

### Permission Issues

Ensure the script has execute permissions:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/hf.sh
```

### Download Failures

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Network connectivity**: Check internet connection
2. **Repository access**: Verify the repository exists and is public
3. **File name**: Ensure the file name is correct (case-sensitive)
4. **Disk space**: Check available disk space for large models

### Library Download Issues

For `gollama-download` issues:

```bash
# Clean cache and retry
make clean-libs
make test-download

# Test with verbose output
go run ./cmd/gollama-download -test-download -v
```
