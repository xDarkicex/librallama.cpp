## Long-term Vision (wait for purego struct support)

### Features Requiring purego Struct Support
These features depend on purego's ability to handle struct parameters and return values, which is currently only available on Darwin (macOS) platforms. They will be moved to active development once purego gains cross-platform struct support.

**Technical Dependencies:**
- purego struct parameter support on Windows/Linux
- purego struct return value support on Windows/Linux
- Cross-platform function registration for struct-based APIs

## Long-term Vision (wait for llama.cpp)

### Features Requiring llama.cpp Function Implementation
These features depend on specific llama.cpp functions that are either missing or not fully implemented in the current version. They will be moved to active development once the required functions become available.

#### Model Processing and Conversion
- [ ] Model quantization utilities - *Requires full quantization API*
- [ ] Model format conversion tools - *Requires conversion functions*
- [ ] Model performance profiling - *Requires timing/profiling functions*
